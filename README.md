## Description

This repo contains some of the ideas that were used to develop a game with multiple game modes. Photon Fusion was used for the networking needs. 

The game needed high precision movement and collision so we looked into:

- Prediction
- Reconciliation
- Interpolation

to make sure what player sees is what player gets as much as possible.
